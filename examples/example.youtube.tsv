EDL	00:01:52,400	00:01:55,920	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	because we do live in a time in which

EDL	00:01:59,700	00:02:02,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	as the geopolitical context in which our

EDL	00:02:21,180	00:02:24,870	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to think about them seriously to address

EDL	00:03:02,970	00:03:07,140	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	global power for the last five to six
EDL	00:03:07,140	00:03:10,860	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	hundred years the world has been
EDL	00:03:10,860	00:03:14,130	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	dominated politically by the Atlantic
EDL	00:03:14,130	00:03:17,970	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	powers by countries located on the
EDL	00:03:17,970	00:03:21,209	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	shores of North Atlantic Ocean and while
EDL	00:03:21,209	00:03:23,610	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	many of them struggled with each other
EDL	00:03:23,610	00:03:27,300	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and predominance within that cluster of
EDL	00:03:27,300	00:03:30,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	states alternated over the five to six
EDL	00:03:30,000	00:03:32,070	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	hundred years the fact is that
EDL	00:03:32,070	00:03:35,430	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	cumulative Lee they in different ways
EDL	00:03:35,430	00:03:38,280	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and degrees have dominated the world
EDL	00:03:38,280	00:03:40,870	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	scene that is
EDL	00:03:40,870	00:03:43,480	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	coming to an end it is now almost
EDL	00:03:43,480	00:03:46,060	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	commonplace to note that the center of
EDL	00:03:46,060	00:03:49,120	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	gravity of political power in the world
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:53,050	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	is shifting eastward through Stasia to
EDL	00:03:53,050	00:03:55,690	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Pacific it doesn't mean that the
EDL	00:03:55,690	00:03:59,410	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	scales of power have tipped but they're
EDL	00:03:59,410	00:04:02,379	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	no longer one-sidedly in favor of the
EDL	00:04:02,379	00:04:05,560	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Atlantic world and the process is in one
EDL	00:04:05,560	00:04:08,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	direction and the center of gravity is
EDL	00:04:08,650	00:04:11,980	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	no longer on the edges but somewhere in
EDL	00:04:11,980	00:04:14,440	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the middle and shifting to the other end
EDL	00:04:14,440	00:04:18,100	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and that second that creates a new
EDL	00:04:18,100	00:04:21,519	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	global pecking order if we were to
EDL	00:04:21,519	00:04:25,240	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	simply enumerate which countries which
EDL	00:04:25,240	00:04:27,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	states are the most important players in
EDL	00:04:27,220	00:04:29,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the world scene I think we would all
EDL	00:04:29,650	00:04:31,630	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	agree that of course the United States
EDL	00:04:31,630	00:04:36,789	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	has the greatest collective in capacity
EDL	00:04:36,789	00:04:40,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	for exercising of predominant influence
EDL	00:04:40,710	00:04:43,449	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	political Benadryl technological
EDL	00:04:43,449	00:04:46,380	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	economic intellectual and so forth and
EDL	00:04:46,380	00:04:48,669	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	incidentally the intellectual is not to
EDL	00:04:48,669	00:04:51,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	be underestimated today the American
EDL	00:04:51,010	00:04:54,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	model is very much under critique around
EDL	00:04:54,940	00:04:57,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the world and the shortcomings of
EDL	00:04:57,220	00:04:59,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	American society are being widely
EDL	00:04:59,530	00:05:02,919	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	discussed and in many respects Americans
EDL	00:05:02,919	00:05:05,139	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	themselves have lately become very
EDL	00:05:05,139	00:05:07,750	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	conscious of the shortcomings of our
EDL	00:05:07,750	00:05:10,810	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	system a system in which we have an
EDL	00:05:10,810	00:05:13,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	evidence for the greedy financial class

EDL	00:05:13,650	00:05:17,169	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	we have a political system increasingly
EDL	00:05:17,169	00:05:21,849	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	susceptible to financial manipulation we
EDL	00:05:21,849	00:05:24,760	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	have disparities and wealth which are
EDL	00:05:24,760	00:05:28,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the greatest among most developed
EDL	00:05:28,150	00:05:30,820	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	responsible countries and we have
EDL	00:05:30,820	00:05:33,550	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	significant displacement of social
EDL	00:05:33,550	00:05:36,700	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	talent social capital because of the
EDL	00:05:36,700	00:05:39,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	basic shifts in the way our economic
EDL	00:05:39,910	00:05:43,419	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	system operates but in that context the
EDL	00:05:43,419	00:05:46,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	intellectual preeminence of the United
EDL	00:05:46,150	00:05:48,360	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	States is still Universal economic
EDL	00:05:48,360	00:05:50,430	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and I think it's particularly fitting to
EDL	00:05:50,430	00:05:53,100	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	note that in a first-class university
EDL	00:05:53,100	00:05:55,500	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	like Brigham Young which is simply one
EDL	00:05:55,500	00:05:58,199	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of many American institutions of this
EDL	00:05:58,199	00:06:01,319	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	kind which have no peers throughout the
EDL	00:06:01,319	00:06:03,180	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	world and it's not the maximum for
EDL	00:06:03,180	00:06:05,849	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	example but so many foreign students are
EDL	00:06:05,849	00:06:09,270	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	here in Provo in Utah where they could
EDL	00:06:09,270	00:06:11,639	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	be in Western Europe they couldn't be in
EDL	00:06:11,639	00:06:12,930	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Far East there could be in their
EDL	00:06:12,930	00:06:14,990	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	home countries the intellectual
EDL	00:06:14,990	00:06:17,849	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	leadership of the United States is still
EDL	00:06:17,849	00:06:20,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	well entrenched but it is at that level
EDL	00:06:20,460	00:06:23,070	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	if you go down the educational ladder
EDL	00:06:23,070	00:06:25,919	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	you look at secondary education if you
EDL	00:06:25,919	00:06:27,840	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	look at primary education that
EDL	00:06:27,840	00:06:30,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	leadership isn't quite but it could be
EDL	00:06:30,210	00:06:31,289	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	for the odd to be
EDL	00:06:31,289	00:06:33,660	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and significant inferior to many
EDL	00:06:33,660	00:06:35,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	countries in the world but nonetheless
EDL	00:06:35,400	00:06:38,280	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the United States don't has the
EDL	00:06:38,280	00:06:41,699	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	composite mix of elements of power which
EDL	00:06:41,699	00:06:43,830	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	makes it a preeminent power and it's
EDL	00:06:43,830	00:06:47,669	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	likely to remain so I think I can say
EDL	00:06:47,669	00:06:50,520	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	confidently maybe for 20 more years
EDL	00:06:50,520	00:06:53,520	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	after that becomes a question mark that
EDL	00:06:53,520	00:06:55,830	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in itself is already ominous there was a
EDL	00:06:55,830	00:06:58,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	time not long ago in the last 15 or so
EDL	00:06:58,710	00:07:01,229	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	years when we emerged as the only
EDL	00:07:01,229	00:07:03,960	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	superpower in the world but there tended
EDL	00:07:03,960	00:07:06,419	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to be a presumption that this would be
EDL	00:07:06,419	00:07:09,810	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	long enduring and without too much
EDL	00:07:09,810	00:07:13,080	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	uncertainty and now at least there's
EDL	00:07:13,080	00:07:15,030	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	uncertainty it's not the same thing as
EDL	00:07:15,030	00:07:18,539	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	for telling the inevitable collapse of
EDL	00:07:18,539	00:07:21,570	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Merton preeminence but for the first
EDL	00:07:21,570	00:07:24,449	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	time ever the possibility cannot be
EDL	00:07:24,449	00:07:27,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	entirely excluded and one can only be
EDL	00:07:27,000	00:07:29,960	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	absolutely confident about 20 years of
EDL	00:07:29,960	00:07:33,270	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	whose second in this kind of arbitrary
EDL	00:07:33,270	00:07:35,219	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	mechanical way of picking the global
EDL	00:07:35,219	00:07:38,340	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	pecking order I suppose one could argue
EDL	00:07:38,340	00:07:42,240	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the European Union the EU certainly in
EDL	00:07:42,240	00:07:44,630	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	terms of overall economic power
EDL	00:07:44,630	00:07:48,120	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	intellectual capacity innovative
EDL	00:07:48,120	00:07:52,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	dynamics a way of life which is decent
EDL	00:07:52,460	00:07:57,120	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	attractive stable reasonably socially
EDL	00:07:57,120	00:08:00,060	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	just the EU circus
EDL	00:08:00,060	00:08:02,970	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	but one key ingredient is clearly
EDL	00:08:02,970	00:08:08,390	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	missing political will support it by
EDL	00:08:08,390	00:08:11,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	military power and hence the question is
EDL	00:08:11,640	00:08:14,880	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	does it really rank second it's a
EDL	00:08:14,880	00:08:17,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	question one it has the potential to be
EDL	00:08:17,010	00:08:19,380	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	so conceivably even in some
EDL	00:08:19,380	00:08:21,990	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	circumstances it could outstrip the
EDL	00:08:21,990	00:08:24,930	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	United States but since it is unlikely
EDL	00:08:24,930	00:08:27,720	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that it will match American military
EDL	00:08:27,720	00:08:29,880	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	power in the foreseeable future and
EDL	00:08:29,880	00:08:33,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	since it is almost equally unlikely that
EDL	00:08:33,150	00:08:35,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	it will have demonstrable and unified
EDL	00:08:35,400	00:08:38,700	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	political will obviously a major
EDL	00:08:38,700	00:08:42,299	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	question mark behind EU is justified so
EDL	00:08:42,299	00:08:43,080	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	whose third
EDL	00:08:43,080	00:08:46,500	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	I think clearly China everyone of course
EDL	00:08:46,500	00:08:48,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in those China is aware of the
EDL	00:08:48,210	00:08:50,520	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	infrastructural backwardness of the
EDL	00:08:50,520	00:08:53,730	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	country in many respects still it's a
EDL	00:08:53,730	00:08:56,340	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	very unevenly developed country but at
EDL	00:08:56,340	00:09:00,540	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the same time in the forward thrust of
EDL	00:09:00,540	00:09:03,750	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	China the innovation and transformation
EDL	00:09:03,750	00:09:07,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of China is truly without precedent in
EDL	00:09:07,650	00:09:09,600	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	history those of us who have been
EDL	00:09:09,600	00:09:11,370	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	traveling to China and I have over the
EDL	00:09:11,370	00:09:13,070	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	last thirty years quite a few times
EDL	00:09:13,070	00:09:15,360	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	since the days when I was engaged
EDL	00:09:15,360	00:09:17,340	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	directly in negotiating with them
EDL	00:09:17,340	00:09:19,590	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	shopping the normalization of our
EDL	00:09:19,590	00:09:21,960	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	relations China has been visibly

EDL	00:09:24,600	00:09:27,090	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	impossible to anticipate but if I'm one
EDL	00:09:27,090	00:09:29,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	first went to China and this dynamism is
EDL	00:09:29,640	00:09:32,570	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	continuing on short of a tremendous
EDL	00:09:32,570	00:09:35,700	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	reversal in China's fortune clearly
EDL	00:09:35,700	00:09:39,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	China is on the rise it is numbered to
EDL	00:09:39,150	00:09:43,470	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	de facto in terms of cumulative capacity
EDL	00:09:43,470	00:09:46,740	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	for leadership and it has the potential
EDL	00:09:46,740	00:09:48,390	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	we all know this we have seen these
EDL	00:09:48,390	00:09:49,890	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	figures there's nothing new in this what
EDL	00:09:49,890	00:09:52,230	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	I'm saying to outstrip the United States
EDL	00:09:52,230	00:09:55,590	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	if we don't improve our performance and
EDL	00:09:55,590	00:09:58,350	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	if they do not falter and these are two
EDL	00:09:58,350	00:10:00,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	major question marks after that it
EDL	00:10:00,900	00:10:04,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	becomes more complicated Russia
EDL	00:10:04,190	00:10:08,930	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	perhaps but it is a one-dimensional
EDL	00:10:08,930	00:10:12,589	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	is 1-dimensional power with of course it
EDL	00:10:12,589	00:10:14,660	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	is proportionate amount of military
EDL	00:10:14,660	00:10:18,080	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	capability including the capacity to
EDL	00:10:18,080	00:10:20,600	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	inflict fundamental damage in any other
EDL	00:10:20,600	00:10:23,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	country in the world essentially
EDL	00:10:23,000	00:10:26,690	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	capacity to destroy another Society but
EDL	00:10:26,690	00:10:29,779	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	it is also a power which autumn Italy is
EDL	00:10:29,779	00:10:32,180	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	a suicidal power in the sense that if
EDL	00:10:32,180	00:10:35,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that capacity is exercised it is an act
EDL	00:10:35,000	00:10:38,029	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of suicide because it will produce such
EDL	00:10:38,029	00:10:40,930	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	retaliation from the United States but
EDL	00:10:40,930	00:10:44,240	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Russia will cease to exist as a society
EDL	00:10:44,240	00:10:47,120	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and increasingly in the new world system
EDL	00:10:47,120	00:10:50,510	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the new world context that power becomes
EDL	00:10:50,510	00:10:53,060	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	increasingly of diminished significance
EDL	00:10:53,060	00:10:56,209	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	when I was in the White House in one of
EDL	00:10:56,209	00:10:59,060	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	my potentially critical jobs was to
EDL	00:10:59,060	00:11:00,800	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	coordinate the presidential nuclear
EDL	00:11:00,800	00:11:03,529	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	response in the event of a nuclear war
EDL	00:11:03,529	00:11:06,320	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	with the Soviet Union and that was a
EDL	00:11:06,320	00:11:08,240	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	real possibility at a time we actually
EDL	00:11:08,240	00:11:11,570	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	worried about it day after day we sense
EDL	00:11:11,570	00:11:13,760	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	our own vulnerability would the
EDL	00:11:13,760	00:11:16,520	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	president survive would be able to
EDL	00:11:16,520	00:11:18,709	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	respond effectively depending on the
EDL	00:11:18,709	00:11:21,140	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	nature of the Russian attack and we all
EDL	00:11:21,140	00:11:23,779	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	knew that if the attack came within a
EDL	00:11:23,779	00:11:27,170	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	few hours between 80 220 million
EDL	00:11:27,170	00:11:30,350	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Americans and Russians would be dead
EDL	00:11:30,350	00:11:33,290	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	within just a few hours those are
EDL	00:11:33,290	00:11:35,779	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	inconceivable figures and yet that was
EDL	00:11:35,779	00:11:39,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the reality and the President had few
EDL	00:11:39,650	00:11:42,140	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	minutes in which to make decisions it is
EDL	00:11:42,140	00:11:44,120	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	no longer a secret but at the time he
EDL	00:11:44,120	00:11:46,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	was a secret the system essentially
EDL	00:11:46,220	00:11:48,800	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	involved the national security of eyes
EDL	00:11:48,800	00:11:50,450	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	are being notified that we're under
EDL	00:11:50,450	00:11:51,100	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	attack
EDL	00:11:51,100	00:11:54,490	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	he has three minutes to confirm
EDL	00:11:54,490	00:11:56,990	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	subsequent sources of information as to
EDL	00:11:56,990	00:11:59,209	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the nature of the tag and the likely
EDL	00:11:59,209	00:12:01,520	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	targeting by the thirty-minute he has to
EDL	00:12:01,520	00:12:03,260	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	get in touch with the president let's in
EDL	00:12:03,260	00:12:05,060	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the middle of the night mr. president
EDL	00:12:05,060	00:12:07,279	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	wake up race not news for you we're
EDL	00:12:07,279	00:12:10,279	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	under attack he then has for the third
EDL	00:12:10,279	00:12:14,140	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	minute to the seventh minute assuming he
EDL	00:12:14,140	00:12:17,130	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	simply doesn't fade out faint
EDL	00:12:17,130	00:12:19,980	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	refuse to believe this news to look ad
EDL	00:12:19,980	00:12:22,440	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the options which are always available
EDL	00:12:22,440	00:12:25,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to them and decide on the basis of the
EDL	00:12:25,710	00:12:28,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	information conveyed the nature of the
EDL	00:12:28,710	00:12:31,980	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	US response in the meantime the
EDL	00:12:31,980	00:12:34,050	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Strategic Air Command is activated and
EDL	00:12:34,050	00:12:35,970	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	begins to take off all over the world
EDL	00:12:35,970	00:12:40,560	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and by the seventh minute the order to
EDL	00:12:40,560	00:12:42,870	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	execute has to be given because if it
EDL	00:12:42,870	00:12:45,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	isn't given by then there's a high
EDL	00:12:45,150	00:12:47,040	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	probability that may not be effectively
EDL	00:12:47,040	00:12:50,160	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	implemented if it is much delayed and by
EDL	00:12:50,160	00:12:52,290	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the 28th minute the nuclear exchange
EDL	00:12:52,290	00:12:54,840	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	takes place of some sort depending on
EDL	00:12:54,840	00:12:56,430	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the nature of the scale of the tank and
EDL	00:12:56,430	00:12:59,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	our response and as I said earlier
EDL	00:12:59,190	00:13:03,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	within a few hours scores and scores of
EDL	00:13:03,330	00:13:06,180	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	millions of people are dead the Soviet

EDL	00:13:08,880	00:13:11,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	capacity destroy us or we have the
EDL	00:13:11,400	00:13:14,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	capacity to destroy them but in all the

EDL	00:13:15,900	00:13:20,610	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Russia is really not a superpower it is

EDL	00:13:31,950	00:13:34,920	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	lagged and it is an economy which has
EDL	00:13:34,920	00:13:38,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	become distorted by becoming essentially
EDL	00:13:38,010	00:13:40,920	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Russian equivalent of Saudi Arabia
EDL	00:13:40,920	00:13:43,890	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	or worse of Nigeria with all the

EDL	00:13:47,340	00:13:49,770	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in which there are such short term
EDL	00:13:49,770	00:13:54,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	enormous profits and a temptation in

EDL	00:14:38,710	00:14:43,300	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in justices a political system which is
EDL	00:14:43,300	00:14:46,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	largely traditional and foreign in
EDL	00:14:46,000	00:14:49,390	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	origins and which operates on the basis
EDL	00:14:49,390	00:14:53,470	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of a society in which large parts of the

EDL	00:15:25,090	00:15:29,280	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to fashion clear lines of direction of
EDL	00:15:29,280	00:15:31,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	defining priorities and we see this for
EDL	00:15:31,900	00:15:34,200	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	example in this struggle of climate over

EDL	00:15:58,480	00:16:01,630	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	political awakening and that is the fact
EDL	00:16:01,630	00:16:05,050	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	but for the first time in all of human

EDL	00:16:11,130	00:16:14,140	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	politically activated politically
EDL	00:16:14,140	00:16:16,760	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	conscious and politically into
EDL	00:16:16,760	00:16:20,110	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	connected that's a totally new condition
EDL	00:16:20,110	00:16:22,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which emerged just in the course of the
EDL	00:16:22,640	00:16:25,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	last 200 years it started with the
EDL	00:16:25,010	00:16:27,320	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	French Revolution which was the first

EDL	00:16:30,410	00:16:32,720	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	galvanized in the political
EDL	00:16:32,720	00:16:35,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	consciousness through struggle and
EDL	00:16:35,330	00:16:39,470	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	violence revolutionary collisions but it

EDL	00:16:51,160	00:16:53,510	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	American Revolution was much more
EDL	00:16:53,510	00:16:56,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Pacific in that sense that it really
EDL	00:16:56,150	00:16:58,670	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	didn't galvanize the same extent of
EDL	00:16:58,670	00:17:02,090	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	social mobilization involving active
EDL	00:17:02,090	00:17:05,780	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	conscious commitment it was much more
EDL	00:17:05,780	00:17:08,449	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	limited in his focus the desire of
EDL	00:17:08,449	00:17:10,430	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	independence from the British Empire
EDL	00:17:10,430	00:17:12,890	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	from the king particularly the realm of
EDL	00:17:12,890	00:17:15,260	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Taxation but it didn't have all the
EDL	00:17:15,260	00:17:18,050	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	other elements of social and ethnic
EDL	00:17:18,050	00:17:21,230	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	active ization and that revolution then

EDL	00:17:25,220	00:17:27,319	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	spreading through the awakening of

EDL	00:17:44,540	00:17:46,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and then spreading in the course of the

EDL	00:17:59,050	00:18:02,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	because of the impact mass mobilizing
EDL	00:18:02,000	00:18:05,030	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	impact of World War two and of course
EDL	00:18:05,030	00:18:07,850	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the appearance in the meantime first of
EDL	00:18:07,850	00:18:09,670	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	all of pamphleteering

EDL	00:18:11,770	00:18:14,030	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	permitted the greater mobilization of

EDL	00:18:45,250	00:18:48,310	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	now essentially universalized so we're
EDL	00:18:48,310	00:18:50,680	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	dealing with a globally politically
EDL	00:18:50,680	00:18:54,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	awakened public but what is very
EDL	00:18:54,190	00:18:56,380	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	important in that context to recognize
EDL	00:18:56,380	00:18:59,290	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	is that political awakening moves
EDL	00:18:59,290	00:19:03,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	through stages through stages of intense
EDL	00:19:03,190	00:19:05,920	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	commitment and particularly in its early
EDL	00:19:05,920	00:19:06,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	phases
EDL	00:19:06,640	00:19:12,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	it's an extremist lee extremist militant
EDL	00:19:12,460	00:19:15,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	commitment in which historical
EDL	00:19:15,910	00:19:19,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	narratives are simplified to present a
EDL	00:19:19,900	00:19:24,160	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	highly Manichaean picture of reality in
EDL	00:19:24,160	00:19:28,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which foes and friends are sharply
EDL	00:19:28,210	00:19:31,030	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	demarcated and engaged in titanic
EDL	00:19:31,030	00:19:33,550	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	struggles and once identity where their
EDL	00:19:33,550	00:19:37,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	religious or ethnic is asserted in an
EDL	00:19:37,000	00:19:40,440	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	absolutely self-righteous fashion and
EDL	00:19:40,440	00:19:42,820	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	with a great inclination to the use of
EDL	00:19:42,820	00:19:46,690	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	violence over time that violence then
EDL	00:19:46,690	00:19:49,990	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	saps that energy teaches painful lessons
EDL	00:19:49,990	00:19:53,490	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	about the benefits of compromise and
EDL	00:19:53,490	00:19:56,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	these emotions subside as they have for
EDL	00:19:56,710	00:19:59,410	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	example in Europe in the last half a
EDL	00:19:59,410	00:20:02,230	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	century but for the previous century and
EDL	00:20:02,230	00:20:04,060	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	a half Europe was the vortex of much
EDL	00:20:04,060	00:20:06,100	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	blood violence and of course it's spread
EDL	00:20:06,100	00:20:09,370	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	elsewhere and today we see this this
EDL	00:20:09,370	00:20:11,590	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	inclination towards extremism and
EDL	00:20:11,590	00:20:14,160	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	fanaticism and the merging of ethnicity
EDL	00:20:14,160	00:20:17,320	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	nationalism is most acute form sometimes
EDL	00:20:17,320	00:20:20,470	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	with religion is very evident about the
EDL	00:20:20,470	00:20:22,570	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	world in which the United States is
EDL	00:20:22,570	00:20:26,200	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	engaged and that brings me therefore to
EDL	00:20:26,200	00:20:28,740	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	discussion of three major geopolitical
EDL	00:20:28,740	00:20:31,240	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	challenges that the United States faces
EDL	00:20:31,240	00:20:35,410	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in that context and I will try to give
EDL	00:20:35,410	00:20:38,020	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	you a summary perception of them as I
EDL	00:20:38,020	00:20:40,990	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	see them but I'd like also to invite you
EDL	00:20:40,990	00:20:43,660	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to think of what I am suggesting as the
EDL	00:20:43,660	00:20:46,300	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	proper responses and I will certainly
EDL	00:20:46,300	00:20:49,540	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	welcome challenges in regards to that
EDL	00:20:49,540	00:20:51,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	because these are issues that we as
EDL	00:20:51,400	00:20:53,890	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	citizens should all be seriously
EDL	00:20:53,890	00:20:56,800	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	concerned with and reflect on them in a
EDL	00:20:56,800	00:20:59,020	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	responsible fashion because these
EDL	00:20:59,020	00:21:02,170	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	challenges are likely to determine
EDL	00:21:02,170	00:21:04,600	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	depending on how effective our response
EDL	00:21:04,600	00:21:08,470	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	is or is not the future of this country
EDL	00:21:08,470	00:21:12,370	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in the world at large but the future of
EDL	00:21:12,370	00:21:14,680	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	America and the world at large will
EDL	00:21:14,680	00:21:15,280	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	impinge
EDL	00:21:15,280	00:21:17,740	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	positively or negatively in a very
EDL	00:21:17,740	00:21:21,160	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	direct fashion on the quality of life in
EDL	00:21:21,160	00:21:23,560	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the United States itself and that's
EDL	00:21:23,560	00:21:25,230	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	something one has to think about very
EDL	00:21:25,230	00:21:28,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	seriously the younger generation here
EDL	00:21:28,330	00:21:31,510	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	will be living with the legacies of the
EDL	00:21:31,510	00:21:33,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	decisions that are made in the near
EDL	00:21:33,010	00:21:36,430	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	future and our grandchildren will have
EDL	00:21:36,430	00:21:39,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	their lives determined by how well or
EDL	00:21:39,910	00:21:43,120	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	badly we perform on the global scene so
EDL	00:21:43,120	00:21:44,800	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	these are matters of the greatest
EDL	00:21:44,800	00:21:47,320	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	importance and I'll be very interested
EDL	00:21:47,320	00:21:50,980	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	also to know what you think there are
EDL	00:21:50,980	00:21:53,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	three such challenges to which I'm going
EDL	00:21:53,650	00:21:55,660	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to speak more specifically I'll address
EDL	00:21:55,660	00:21:58,600	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the first more fully the other two more
EDL	00:21:58,600	00:22:02,830	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	briefly the first is the challenge of an
EDL	00:22:02,830	00:22:06,430	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	increasingly debilitating military
EDL	00:22:06,430	00:22:09,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	involvement by the United States in a
EDL	00:22:09,640	00:22:12,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	part of the world which I've called the
EDL	00:22:12,400	00:22:13,120	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	global
EDL	00:22:13,120	00:22:16,810	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Balkans and of course of the related

EDL	00:22:21,350	00:22:25,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	consequences of that involvement when I
EDL	00:22:25,910	00:22:28,700	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	speak of the global Balkans I mean that
EDL	00:22:28,700	00:22:32,809	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	part of the world that ranges from east
EDL	00:22:32,809	00:22:37,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of Suez to west of Sanjana I was told
EDL	00:22:37,940	00:22:40,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	today in my meeting with a political
EDL	00:22:40,220	00:22:43,700	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	science faculty that these students of

EDL	00:22:45,380	00:22:48,169	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	well-informed about geography so I

EDL	00:22:57,260	00:23:01,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Russia's new southern boundary all the
EDL	00:23:01,220	00:23:02,929	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	way down to the Indian Ocean
EDL	00:23:02,929	00:23:06,919	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	it's about 550 million people largely
EDL	00:23:06,919	00:23:10,909	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	but not exclusively Muslim but of
EDL	00:23:10,909	00:23:13,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	different orientations different
EDL	00:23:13,220	00:23:15,620	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	ethnicity which is just as important as
EDL	00:23:15,620	00:23:18,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	religious fervor with the legacy of
EDL	00:23:18,530	00:23:22,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	different collisions and with a growing
EDL	00:23:22,400	00:23:25,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	tendency towards fragmentation in the
EDL	00:23:25,460	00:23:28,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	region as a whole the United States is
EDL	00:23:28,940	00:23:33,020	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	deeply engaged in that area and one of
EDL	00:23:33,020	00:23:34,909	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the manifestations of the violence in
EDL	00:23:34,909	00:23:38,059	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that area is the growing hostility a
EDL	00:23:38,059	00:23:40,100	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	great many of the people living in that
EDL	00:23:40,100	00:23:43,429	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	area towards the United States in part
EDL	00:23:43,429	00:23:46,280	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	because of the way they interpret our
EDL	00:23:46,280	00:23:49,429	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	policies and our role in that part of
EDL	00:23:49,429	00:23:51,549	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the world and I'll come back to that
EDL	00:23:51,549	00:23:54,200	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the second problem I want to talk about
EDL	00:23:54,200	00:23:57,890	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	is the increasing risk of the
EDL	00:23:57,890	00:24:01,760	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	progressive marginalization of American
EDL	00:24:01,760	00:24:04,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	preeminence in East Asia and the Far
EDL	00:24:04,220	00:24:07,340	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	East this is now underway it is
EDL	00:24:07,340	00:24:10,580	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	associated obviously uh neva tably with
EDL	00:24:10,580	00:24:13,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the fact that Asian powers are now
EDL	00:24:13,010	00:24:15,350	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	rising in significance and it is
EDL	00:24:15,350	00:24:17,240	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	therefore also connected with the
EDL	00:24:17,240	00:24:19,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	decline of the predominance of the
EDL	00:24:19,460	00:24:21,860	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Atlantic world in the world at large and
EDL	00:24:21,860	00:24:25,070	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	more specifically in that part of the
EDL	00:24:25,070	00:24:28,850	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	world East Asia in the Far East and the
EDL	00:24:28,850	00:24:32,659	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	third is the resultant danger resultant
EDL	00:24:32,659	00:24:33,720	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	danger of the four
EDL	00:24:33,720	00:24:38,429	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	- or a progressive drift away or drift
EDL	00:24:38,429	00:24:40,950	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	apart between the United States and
EDL	00:24:40,950	00:24:44,009	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Europe and that of course is critically
EDL	00:24:44,009	00:24:45,450	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	relevant to the point that I started
EDL	00:24:45,450	00:24:47,909	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	with namely the decline of the Atlantic
EDL	00:24:47,909	00:24:50,840	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	world because it is the Atlantic world
EDL	00:24:50,840	00:24:53,850	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that involves American Europe as of a
EDL	00:24:53,850	00:24:56,909	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	single general political force in the
EDL	00:24:56,909	00:25:00,240	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	world and it has been dominant since the
EDL	00:25:00,240	00:25:05,879	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	end of well certainly worldwide it was
EDL	00:25:05,879	00:25:08,490	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	dominant since five to sixteen years but
EDL	00:25:08,490	00:25:10,019	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	much more directly with American
EDL	00:25:10,019	00:25:13,169	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	participation since the end of World War
EDL	00:25:13,169	00:25:16,620	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	one so it's a whole historical era that
EDL	00:25:16,620	00:25:18,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	now is coming to an end
EDL	00:25:18,000	00:25:21,360	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and a split between American Europe
EDL	00:25:21,360	00:25:24,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	would greatly accelerate that process
EDL	00:25:24,000	00:25:27,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and reduce significantly the capacity of
EDL	00:25:27,330	00:25:29,370	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	either partner to play a constructive
EDL	00:25:29,370	00:25:33,750	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and decisive role in the world scene let
EDL	00:25:33,750	00:25:36,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	me turn therefore in this generalized
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,409	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	context that I've stretched out
EDL	00:25:37,409	00:25:40,139	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	specifically to the problems posed by
EDL	00:25:40,139	00:25:44,730	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the u.s. involvement east of Suez it
EDL	00:25:44,730	00:25:47,580	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	started as all you recall with the
EDL	00:25:47,580	00:25:50,490	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	British decision to leave that part of
EDL	00:25:50,490	00:25:54,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the world in the mid 1950s the British
EDL	00:25:54,000	00:25:56,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	could no longer sustain their imperial
EDL	00:25:56,460	00:25:59,039	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	preeminence to put it very simply they
EDL	00:25:59,039	00:26:02,070	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	couldn't afford it and as a result they
EDL	00:26:02,070	00:26:04,590	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	concluded that they have to leave and we
EDL	00:26:04,590	00:26:07,559	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	concluded that we have to step in we
EDL	00:26:07,559	00:26:09,450	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	assumed in effect the imperial mantle
EDL	00:26:09,450	00:26:12,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and it is worth recalling that by and
EDL	00:26:12,210	00:26:15,120	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	large in the Middle East America's
EDL	00:26:15,120	00:26:17,159	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	entrance into a preeminent role was
EDL	00:26:17,159	00:26:20,549	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	generally welcomed in the area because
EDL	00:26:20,549	00:26:23,009	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	we were seen as in many respects
EDL	00:26:23,009	00:26:26,250	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	replacing the Imperial preponderance of
EDL	00:26:26,250	00:26:28,009	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the French and the British a
EDL	00:26:28,009	00:26:30,659	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	preponderance which by then the
EDL	00:26:30,659	00:26:33,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	population of this region started to
EDL	00:26:33,330	00:26:36,419	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	resent because of global political
EDL	00:26:36,419	00:26:38,909	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	awakening stimulated by World War one
EDL	00:26:38,909	00:26:40,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and World War two in
EDL	00:26:40,640	00:26:44,450	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	part of the world the United States in
EDL	00:26:44,450	00:26:48,549	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	turn then gradually became the object of
EDL	00:26:48,549	00:26:52,610	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	increasing political resentment which in
EDL	00:26:52,610	00:26:55,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	time began to acquire the manifestations
EDL	00:26:55,400	00:26:58,309	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	also religious hostility towards the
EDL	00:26:58,309	00:27:01,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	United States because of the inability
EDL	00:27:01,010	00:27:04,280	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of the United States to constructively
EDL	00:27:04,280	00:27:07,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	resolve the persisting conflict between
EDL	00:27:07,190	00:27:10,100	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Israel and Palestinians without getting
EDL	00:27:10,100	00:27:12,230	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	involved into the rights and wrongs of
EDL	00:27:12,230	00:27:15,020	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that conflict the fact is that in the
EDL	00:27:15,020	00:27:18,290	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	region American and ability to bring
EDL	00:27:18,290	00:27:20,450	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that conflict to an end as the
EDL	00:27:20,450	00:27:23,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	predominant imperial power was viewed
EDL	00:27:23,210	00:27:26,480	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	essentially by an increasing number of
EDL	00:27:26,480	00:27:30,919	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	people as a hostile intervention into
EDL	00:27:30,919	00:27:33,590	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	their region in an age which was viewed
EDL	00:27:33,590	00:27:36,350	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	as no longer tolerant with imperial
EDL	00:27:36,350	00:27:39,950	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	domination we know of course that the
EDL	00:27:39,950	00:27:43,100	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	invasion of Iraq was resented broadly
EDL	00:27:43,100	00:27:45,260	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	not on in the region but in the world at
EDL	00:27:45,260	00:27:47,799	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	large thereby undermining American
EDL	00:27:47,799	00:27:51,230	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	legitimacy indeed damaging American
EDL	00:27:51,230	00:27:55,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	credibility hostility with Iran erupted
EDL	00:27:55,940	00:27:59,299	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	already some thirty years ago in part as
EDL	00:27:59,299	00:28:01,309	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	a process of self-assertion
EDL	00:28:01,309	00:28:04,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	by the Iranians against what they viewed
EDL	00:28:04,400	00:28:07,429	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	as excessive American domination which
EDL	00:28:07,429	00:28:09,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	replaced the earlier British domination
EDL	00:28:09,710	00:28:14,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	already back in 1953 I was involved in
EDL	00:28:14,000	00:28:15,770	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that and I was of the view at the time
EDL	00:28:15,770	00:28:17,750	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that we should be more actively engaged
EDL	00:28:17,750	00:28:20,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in preventing whom they need from datin
EDL	00:28:20,900	00:28:23,720	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	power because I fear that I would lead
EDL	00:28:23,720	00:28:27,410	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to extreme and American radicalism but I
EDL	00:28:27,410	00:28:30,679	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	have to confess that the intensity of
EDL	00:28:30,679	00:28:33,350	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Iranian nationalism and in simply
EDL	00:28:33,350	00:28:34,340	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	nation to I
EDL	00:28:34,340	00:28:37,029	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	defy itself with religious fanaticism
EDL	00:28:37,029	00:28:40,570	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	came as a surprise at least to me
EDL	00:28:40,570	00:28:43,730	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	although I was still then of the view
EDL	00:28:43,730	00:28:46,520	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that perhaps it could be averted by a
EDL	00:28:46,520	00:28:49,880	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	decisive series of acts on the part of

EDL	00:29:18,730	00:29:20,980	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	terrorism which is one manifestation
EDL	00:29:20,980	00:29:24,080	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which the activated political masses
EDL	00:29:24,080	00:29:28,149	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	wage war against established powers and

EDL	00:29:30,799	00:29:32,980	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	societies are particularly vulnerable
EDL	00:29:32,980	00:29:35,750	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	because terrorism strikes at the very
EDL	00:29:35,750	00:29:37,700	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	essence of the values of democratic
EDL	00:29:37,700	00:29:42,169	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	society that is then the reality we face
EDL	00:29:42,169	00:29:45,529	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	today and we have to face the fact that
EDL	00:29:45,529	00:29:49,570	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the religious nationalist combination of
EDL	00:29:49,570	00:29:52,669	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	emotional hostility towards the United
EDL	00:29:52,669	00:29:56,289	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	States is that byproduct of politically
EDL	00:29:56,289	00:29:59,510	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	fashioned historical circumstances we
EDL	00:29:59,510	00:30:02,149	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	have been unwilling to face that for
EDL	00:30:02,149	00:30:04,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	example in this very sensitive issue of
EDL	00:30:04,190	00:30:06,200	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the relationship of hostility towards
EDL	00:30:06,200	00:30:09,130	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the United States and the
EDL	00:30:09,130	00:30:11,690	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	israeli-palestinian conflict there is a
EDL	00:30:11,690	00:30:14,840	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	tendency to avoid admitting the
EDL	00:30:14,840	00:30:17,480	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	connection if the fact of the matter is
EDL	00:30:17,480	00:30:20,860	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that in three separate statements
EDL	00:30:20,860	00:30:23,750	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	designed to mobilize support against the
EDL	00:30:23,750	00:30:27,679	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	United States and to justify the acts of
EDL	00:30:27,679	00:30:29,450	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	terror against the United States and
EDL	00:30:29,450	00:30:30,669	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	specifically nine
EDL	00:30:30,669	00:30:35,049	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	eleven Osama bin Laden each time in
EDL	00:30:35,049	00:30:37,570	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	these three major statements involves
EDL	00:30:37,570	00:30:40,960	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	specifically the israeli-palestinian
EDL	00:30:40,960	00:30:44,619	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	conflict as one of the two reasons for
EDL	00:30:44,619	00:30:46,989	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	his intense hostility towards the United
EDL	00:30:46,989	00:30:50,470	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	States and for his justification of the
EDL	00:30:50,470	00:30:53,409	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	use of terror even against innocence in
EDL	00:30:53,409	00:30:56,799	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the United States that happens to be a
EDL	00:30:56,799	00:30:59,440	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	fact of life and the fact that he
EDL	00:30:59,440	00:31:02,499	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	invokes these justifications shows that
EDL	00:31:02,499	00:31:04,989	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	he at least feels that there is
EDL	00:31:04,989	00:31:07,539	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	political receptivity and the religious
EDL	00:31:07,539	00:31:10,600	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	receptivity to the argument and that
EDL	00:31:10,600	00:31:14,049	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	strengthens in my mind the argument that
EDL	00:31:14,049	00:31:16,929	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	it is in the imperative interest of the
EDL	00:31:16,929	00:31:18,840	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	United States that the
EDL	00:31:18,840	00:31:21,309	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	israeli-palestinian conflict be resolved
EDL	00:31:21,309	00:31:24,249	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in a fashion that respects the vital
EDL	00:31:24,249	00:31:27,879	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	interests and the rights both of the
EDL	00:31:27,879	00:31:30,570	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Israelis and of the Palestinians and
EDL	00:31:30,570	00:31:33,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that in turn means that we have to be
EDL	00:31:33,460	00:31:36,070	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	willing to face the fact also that
EDL	00:31:36,070	00:31:39,989	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	history shows with some 30 years now of
EDL	00:31:39,989	00:31:43,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	attempted negotiations at peace that the
EDL	00:31:43,330	00:31:45,820	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	two parties the conflict on their own
EDL	00:31:45,820	00:31:49,809	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	will never reach an agreement to put it
EDL	00:31:49,809	00:31:52,149	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	more simply now this is obviously an
EDL	00:31:52,149	00:31:54,669	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	enormously complicated issue the
EDL	00:31:54,669	00:31:56,799	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Palestinians are too weak and to divide
EDL	00:31:56,799	00:31:59,529	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	it and to be able to make the
EDL	00:31:59,529	00:32:03,249	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	fundamental concessions the Israelis are
EDL	00:32:03,249	00:32:07,749	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	too strong and also to divide it to make
EDL	00:32:07,749	00:32:10,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the fundamental concessions and each of
EDL	00:32:10,330	00:32:13,389	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	them has points of sensitivity in which
EDL	00:32:13,389	00:32:16,359	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	one or the other is unable to take the
EDL	00:32:16,359	00:32:18,549	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	initiative because these points of its
EDL	00:32:18,549	00:32:21,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	sensitivity involve the most deeply
EDL	00:32:21,220	00:32:25,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	cherished historical or other values of
EDL	00:32:25,710	00:32:28,840	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	importance to the respective party for
EDL	00:32:28,840	00:32:32,080	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Palestinians the right of return
EDL	00:32:32,080	00:32:34,090	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	refugees because the whole national
EDL	00:32:34,090	00:32:37,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	movement is built around the notion that
EDL	00:32:37,000	00:32:38,649	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	at some point there will be this
EDL	00:32:38,649	00:32:41,890	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	mythical right of return and yet we
EDL	00:32:41,890	00:32:45,390	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	cannot expect Israel to commit suicide
EDL	00:32:45,390	00:32:48,429	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	demographically for the sake of peace so
EDL	00:32:48,429	00:32:50,980	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the right of return really cannot be one
EDL	00:32:50,980	00:32:54,820	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of the basis for reconciliation for the
EDL	00:32:54,820	00:32:57,370	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Israelis identification with chosen and
EDL	00:32:57,370	00:32:59,700	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the notion of the exclusive
EDL	00:32:59,700	00:33:02,350	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	identification of Jerusalem as the
EDL	00:33:02,350	00:33:05,620	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	capital of Israel is organically linked
EDL	00:33:05,620	00:33:07,960	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to their sense of religious identity and
EDL	00:33:07,960	00:33:11,409	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of historic roots with the land of
EDL	00:33:11,409	00:33:13,929	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Abraham and therefore it is impossible
EDL	00:33:13,929	00:33:16,450	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	for them to make that concession and
EDL	00:33:16,450	00:33:19,299	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	certainly not in either case as the
EDL	00:33:19,299	00:33:21,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	point of departure for negotiations
EDL	00:33:21,330	00:33:24,960	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	perhaps the best as the final stage and
EDL	00:33:24,960	00:33:29,260	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	it that cumulatively blocks the process
EDL	00:33:29,260	00:33:32,820	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of negotiations and illustrates why an
EDL	00:33:32,820	00:33:36,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	external intervention is so essential
EDL	00:33:36,010	00:33:38,740	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and that external intervention can only
EDL	00:33:38,740	00:33:41,610	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	come from the United States President
EDL	00:33:41,610	00:33:44,889	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Obama has spoken of his determination to
EDL	00:33:44,889	00:33:49,269	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	move towards peace but so far heavily
EDL	00:33:49,269	00:33:52,059	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	preoccupied with domestic problems he
EDL	00:33:52,059	00:33:54,850	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	has not done so beyond a few generalized
EDL	00:33:54,850	00:33:58,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	statements of his intentions I feared
EDL	00:33:58,210	00:33:59,860	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that if he doesn't move in the near
EDL	00:33:59,860	00:34:02,350	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	future the chance for peace will be lost
EDL	00:34:02,350	00:34:06,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the demographic dynamics are changing in
EDL	00:34:06,220	00:34:09,219	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	favor the Palestinians the polarization
EDL	00:34:09,219	00:34:11,560	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	between the two communities is becoming
EDL	00:34:11,560	00:34:14,859	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	more deeply entrenched the sacrifices
EDL	00:34:14,859	00:34:17,649	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	needed to be made to have peace are
EDL	00:34:17,649	00:34:20,080	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	growing for both sides for the
EDL	00:34:20,080	00:34:22,599	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Palestinians the right of return for the
EDL	00:34:22,599	00:34:25,780	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Israelis settlements land is ultimately
EDL	00:34:25,780	00:34:31,300	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	an issue and only a responsible morally
EDL	00:34:31,300	00:34:33,780	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	based intervention from the
EDL	00:34:33,780	00:34:35,909	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	outside can move the process towards
EDL	00:34:35,909	00:34:38,370	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	peace forward and that can only come
EDL	00:34:38,370	00:34:41,370	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	from the United States and you are in as
EDL	00:34:41,370	00:34:43,770	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	good a position to judge as I as the
EDL	00:34:43,770	00:34:46,380	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	weather that's likely because any such
EDL	00:34:46,380	00:34:48,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	intervention by the United States
EDL	00:34:48,530	00:34:51,960	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	requires a determined presidential
EDL	00:34:51,960	00:34:56,040	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	leadership that is prepared to put
EDL	00:34:56,040	00:34:59,790	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	presidential prospects on the stakes of
EDL	00:34:59,790	00:35:03,360	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	peace and that's a very difficult
EDL	00:35:03,360	00:35:06,420	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	judgment to make my own beliefs de lives
EDL	00:35:06,420	00:35:09,500	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that a president who acts decisively and
EDL	00:35:09,500	00:35:13,820	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	with a clear commitment to a peace of
EDL	00:35:13,820	00:35:17,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	reconciliation based on fundamental
EDL	00:35:17,000	00:35:19,610	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	arrangements of justice and balance
EDL	00:35:19,610	00:35:22,260	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	would command public support in the
EDL	00:35:22,260	00:35:24,390	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	United States including from a
EDL	00:35:24,390	00:35:26,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	significant portion of the Jewish
EDL	00:35:26,640	00:35:29,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	community but that can be contested and
EDL	00:35:29,940	00:35:31,620	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that is problematical it cannot be
EDL	00:35:31,620	00:35:34,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	asserted categorically to be the case my
EDL	00:35:34,650	00:35:36,720	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	own view is the president were to move
EDL	00:35:36,720	00:35:39,030	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	this I survey he would mobilize that
EDL	00:35:39,030	00:35:42,270	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	support but it is also true that the
EDL	00:35:42,270	00:35:45,060	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	initial steps of the painful sharply
EDL	00:35:45,060	00:35:48,270	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	contested and potentially dangerous to
EDL	00:35:48,270	00:35:49,980	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the political prospects of the President
EDL	00:35:49,980	00:35:52,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and especially so if other major
EDL	00:35:52,710	00:35:55,410	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	domestic issues are at stake as they
EDL	00:35:55,410	00:35:58,230	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	have been in the course of this year so
EDL	00:35:58,230	00:36:00,480	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	we are near a point of no return on this
EDL	00:36:00,480	00:36:04,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	issue and yet if we are beyond no return
EDL	00:36:04,530	00:36:08,610	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	it is predictable on a certain that
EDL	00:36:08,610	00:36:10,770	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	hostility towards the United States in
EDL	00:36:10,770	00:36:13,770	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Islamic world in the Middle East
EDL	00:36:13,770	00:36:16,050	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	particularly but now more generally you
EDL	00:36:16,050	00:36:18,060	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	look at the who the terrorists are is
EDL	00:36:18,060	00:36:21,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	going to spread and hence the conflict
EDL	00:36:21,330	00:36:24,870	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	this asymmetric conflict with a
EDL	00:36:24,870	00:36:27,930	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	disorganized volatile large community
EDL	00:36:27,930	00:36:30,110	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	using terrorist means against ourselves
EDL	00:36:30,110	00:36:34,680	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	will intensify but that in turn can make
EDL	00:36:34,680	00:36:35,760	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	other issues worse
EDL	00:36:35,760	00:36:37,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	we have to resolve somehow the
EDL	00:36:37,910	00:36:41,660	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	issue of Iran which is part of this
EDL	00:36:41,660	00:36:43,490	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	complex of issues within the global
EDL	00:36:43,490	00:36:47,839	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Balkans and here I think we have to face
EDL	00:36:47,839	00:36:50,059	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the fact that we're dealing with a
EDL	00:36:50,059	00:36:53,030	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	country of 70 million people which has a
EDL	00:36:53,030	00:36:57,230	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	grand history is profoundly aware of its
EDL	00:36:57,230	00:37:00,619	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	historical and cultural worth and is not
EDL	00:37:00,619	00:37:03,740	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	prepared to be the object of policies
EDL	00:37:03,740	00:37:08,089	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which they view as essentially a legacy
EDL	00:37:08,089	00:37:11,690	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of the imperial past we have to be
EDL	00:37:11,690	00:37:13,730	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	willing to accept Iran for what it is
EDL	00:37:13,730	00:37:17,299	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in spite of them Estonia and in fact our
EDL	00:37:17,299	00:37:19,490	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	acceptance of them in spite of their
EDL	00:37:19,490	00:37:22,700	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	hostility may in time reduce that
EDL	00:37:22,700	00:37:25,549	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	hostility because we already see even on
EDL	00:37:25,549	00:37:27,829	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	television the degree to which there is
EDL	00:37:27,829	00:37:30,380	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	potential in Iran for positive
EDL	00:37:30,380	00:37:32,780	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	evolutionary change towards more
EDL	00:37:32,780	00:37:35,869	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	acceptable political forms and less
EDL	00:37:35,869	00:37:38,720	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	dogmatic doctrinaire and militant
EDL	00:37:38,720	00:37:42,140	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	religious vocation but that requires
EDL	00:37:42,140	00:37:47,500	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	commitment to stable persistent patient
EDL	00:37:47,500	00:37:50,599	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	negotiations I was involved in
EDL	00:37:50,599	00:37:52,069	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	negotiating with the Soviets and the
EDL	00:37:52,069	00:37:55,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Chinese and it took months and years
EDL	00:37:55,900	00:37:59,180	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	we're under pressure to put deadlines of
EDL	00:37:59,180	00:38:00,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	three months in negotiating with the
EDL	00:38:00,710	00:38:03,079	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Iranians and the definition of success
EDL	00:38:03,079	00:38:04,880	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in these negotiations with the
EDL	00:38:04,880	00:38:06,950	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	three-month deadline is the rareness
EDL	00:38:06,950	00:38:10,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	accept what we demand in my view that is
EDL	00:38:10,640	00:38:13,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	not the most constructive definition of
EDL	00:38:13,220	00:38:16,490	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the negotiating strategy unless it is
EDL	00:38:16,490	00:38:19,069	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	designed to fail and then if it is
EDL	00:38:19,069	00:38:20,750	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	designed to fail what is it meant to
EDL	00:38:20,750	00:38:25,339	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	justify a military collision there's
EDL	00:38:25,339	00:38:27,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	talk of a miniature collision either
EDL	00:38:27,710	00:38:30,529	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	with us using force or the Israelis
EDL	00:38:30,529	00:38:34,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	using force but what happens after the
EDL	00:38:34,010	00:38:37,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	force is used it is always easy to
EDL	00:38:37,640	00:38:39,099	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	predict the initial phase of a
EDL	00:38:39,099	00:38:40,930	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	or are you going to make reasonable
EDL	00:38:40,930	00:38:43,930	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	calculus regarding the proportions of
EDL	00:38:43,930	00:38:46,059	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	force the degree of superiority
EDL	00:38:46,059	00:38:49,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	inferiority involved but then more steak
EDL	00:38:49,650	00:38:51,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	unpredictable turns and acquire their
EDL	00:38:51,910	00:38:55,180	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	own new manifestations I think it is
EDL	00:38:55,180	00:38:56,979	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	predictable that there is a strike
EDL	00:38:56,979	00:39:00,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	against Iran either by the Israelis or
EDL	00:39:00,190	00:39:03,309	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	by us and if it is by the Israelis will
EDL	00:39:03,309	00:39:06,099	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	it be blamed anyway because the Iranians
EDL	00:39:06,099	00:39:08,769	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	cannot reciprocate effectively against
EDL	00:39:08,769	00:39:11,799	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Israel sir for their reciprocate against
EDL	00:39:11,799	00:39:16,089	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	us we will be under attack in Iran in
EDL	00:39:16,089	00:39:18,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Iraq where our forces are in the process
EDL	00:39:18,190	00:39:21,339	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of disengagement will be under attack in
EDL	00:39:21,339	00:39:24,819	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	here in Afghanistan where the Iranians
EDL	00:39:24,819	00:39:27,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	are in a position to intervene the
EDL	00:39:27,940	00:39:30,539	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Strait of Hormuz will be set ablaze
EDL	00:39:30,539	00:39:33,160	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	there will be an interruption in the
EDL	00:39:33,160	00:39:36,819	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	flow of oil at a massive spike in the
EDL	00:39:36,819	00:39:39,549	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	price of gasoline for every average
EDL	00:39:39,549	00:39:42,880	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	American increasing dependence of the
EDL	00:39:42,880	00:39:45,369	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Europeans on Russian oil which has
EDL	00:39:45,369	00:39:48,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	geopolitical consequences and of course
EDL	00:39:48,400	00:39:51,249	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	a potential economic crisis both within
EDL	00:39:51,249	00:39:53,920	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the United States and in China because
EDL	00:39:53,920	00:39:56,880	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of Chinese dependence on the Iranian oil
EDL	00:39:56,880	00:39:59,430	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	for the Russians that's a net benefit
EDL	00:39:59,430	00:40:03,009	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	incidentally for us it's a geopolitical
EDL	00:40:03,009	00:40:06,489	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	disaster and therefore we have to face
EDL	00:40:06,489	00:40:10,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	I think logically and why not open a
EDL	00:40:10,150	00:40:15,279	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	defect that force is not an option there
EDL	00:40:15,279	00:40:16,869	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	is a tendency to think that we were
EDL	00:40:16,869	00:40:20,099	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	being strategically very clever by
EDL	00:40:20,099	00:40:25,630	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	reiterating that force is not off the
EDL	00:40:25,630	00:40:28,630	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	table all options are on the table
EDL	00:40:28,630	00:40:31,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and the problem with that is that it
EDL	00:40:31,900	00:40:34,380	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	doesn't drive the Iranians towards
EDL	00:40:34,380	00:40:37,499	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	accommodation it drives them towards
EDL	00:40:37,499	00:40:40,749	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	nationalist unity against us and makes
EDL	00:40:40,749	00:40:43,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the negotiating process disliked
EDL	00:40:43,460	00:40:48,140	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	see and it may not succeed because in
EDL	00:40:48,140	00:40:50,360	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the end the Iranians may not be willing
EDL	00:40:50,360	00:40:53,200	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	or able to make those accommodations
EDL	00:40:53,200	00:40:56,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which would make negotiations more or
EDL	00:40:56,150	00:40:58,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	less successful in some sort of
EDL	00:40:58,940	00:41:01,580	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	compromise formula and there are some so
EDL	00:41:01,580	00:41:03,500	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	maybe there will be no success to these
EDL	00:41:03,500	00:41:06,440	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	negotiations but that is the alternative
EDL	00:41:06,440	00:41:10,760	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	I say that use of force is as much of
EDL	00:41:10,760	00:41:14,870	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the disaster as Iran acquiring a nuclear
EDL	00:41:14,870	00:41:18,620	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	weapon but if there is a recourse to
EDL	00:41:18,620	00:41:21,590	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	force we do know that the consequences
EDL	00:41:21,590	00:41:24,680	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	would be most negative and unpredictable
EDL	00:41:24,680	00:41:27,500	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in their consequences whereas if they do
EDL	00:41:27,500	00:41:30,290	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	acquire the nuclear bond there are
EDL	00:41:30,290	00:41:33,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	things we can do on the basis of our own
EDL	00:41:33,530	00:41:36,290	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	experience which gives us some grants
EDL	00:41:36,290	00:41:39,080	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	for confidence that these alternative
EDL	00:41:39,080	00:41:42,110	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	responses might work and they are well
EDL	00:41:42,110	00:41:45,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	known and tried historically and that is
EDL	00:41:45,530	00:41:49,430	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	deterrence we were able to deter the
EDL	00:41:49,430	00:41:52,790	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	most murderous regime in human history
EDL	00:41:52,790	00:41:54,310	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in fact two of them
EDL	00:41:54,310	00:41:58,040	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Stalin's and Mao Zedong's neither of
EDL	00:41:58,040	00:42:01,160	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which place much value on human life but
EDL	00:42:01,160	00:42:03,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	we deterred them because we convinced
EDL	00:42:03,650	00:42:06,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the bodies involved that use of force

EDL	00:42:09,530	00:42:12,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and our response for example to a
EDL	00:42:12,710	00:42:14,690	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	possible Soviet attack on the United
EDL	00:42:14,690	00:42:18,170	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	States was deliberately designed if
EDL	00:42:18,170	00:42:22,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	necessary to kill as many Russians men
EDL	00:42:22,940	00:42:25,490	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	women and children the entire society as
EDL	00:42:25,490	00:42:29,240	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	is feasible and we had the capacity to
EDL	00:42:29,240	00:42:33,680	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	actually do it and that was credible the
EDL	00:42:33,680	00:42:37,340	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Iranians are difficult occasional
EDL	00:42:37,340	00:42:42,170	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	duplicitous determined evasive but one
EDL	00:42:42,170	00:42:44,740	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	thing they're not they're not suicidal
EDL	00:42:44,740	00:42:48,320	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Iran has been around for a long long
EDL	00:42:48,320	00:42:52,359	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	time more than 2,500 years
EDL	00:42:52,359	00:42:54,849	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and they can be deterred and we can
EDL	00:42:54,849	00:42:58,660	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	protect every country near Iran
EDL	00:42:58,660	00:43:01,690	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	including Israel including the Arab
EDL	00:43:01,690	00:43:04,480	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	states through a blanket guarantee of
EDL	00:43:04,480	00:43:07,299	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	our willingness to protect and I think
EDL	00:43:07,299	00:43:09,130	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	if we are willing to be patient in our
EDL	00:43:09,130	00:43:11,829	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	negotiations clear in our determination
EDL	00:43:11,829	00:43:14,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to prevent the Iranians from benefiting
EDL	00:43:14,710	00:43:17,130	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	from the acquisition of nuclear weapons
EDL	00:43:17,130	00:43:20,739	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	but without maintaining the attitude
EDL	00:43:20,739	00:43:22,420	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	towards negotiations which makes
EDL	00:43:22,420	00:43:24,009	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	negotiations less likely to be
EDL	00:43:24,009	00:43:27,670	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	successful we are more likely to be
EDL	00:43:27,670	00:43:29,980	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	successful the president right now is
EDL	00:43:29,980	00:43:33,430	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	under enormous pressure to ring the bell
EDL	00:43:33,430	00:43:36,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and to in effect say negotiations have
EDL	00:43:36,640	00:43:39,249	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	failed I hope he avoids the temptation
EDL	00:43:39,249	00:43:42,999	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	my sense is he's reluctant to succumb to
EDL	00:43:42,999	00:43:44,920	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that temptation but he is under
EDL	00:43:44,920	00:43:48,039	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	political pressure this issue in turn is
EDL	00:43:48,039	00:43:50,799	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	related to Afghanistan Pakistan that has
EDL	00:43:50,799	00:43:55,180	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	become profoundly debilitating and
EDL	00:43:55,180	00:43:58,539	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	costly American military engagement but
EDL	00:43:58,539	00:44:02,079	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	we have no choice because of 9/11 and we
EDL	00:44:02,079	00:44:05,109	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	have to make certain that after the
EDL	00:44:05,109	00:44:07,660	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	conclusion of hostilities in Afghanistan
EDL	00:44:07,660	00:44:10,180	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	there is no longer a safe haven in
EDL	00:44:10,180	00:44:13,989	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Afghanistan for a repetition of 9/11 for
EDL	00:44:13,989	00:44:17,380	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	allocator to operate with impunity this
EDL	00:44:17,380	00:44:19,329	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	doesn't mean an open-ended military
EDL	00:44:19,329	00:44:23,859	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	engagement towards an ultimate complete
EDL	00:44:23,859	00:44:25,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	victory and I think the president is
EDL	00:44:25,900	00:44:28,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	beginning to signal that it doesn't view
EDL	00:44:28,210	00:44:30,309	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the war that way it's not the way George
EDL	00:44:30,309	00:44:33,749	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Bush viewed it victory democratization
EDL	00:44:33,749	00:44:35,609	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	representative government and
EDL	00:44:35,609	00:44:39,249	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	increasingly modern Afghanistan created
EDL	00:44:39,249	00:44:43,660	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in the wake of a war won by us I think
EDL	00:44:43,660	00:44:45,339	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	we're moving now towards a redefinition
EDL	00:44:45,339	00:44:49,119	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of what success means which means the
EDL	00:44:49,119	00:44:51,700	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Afghans themselves and cheating that
EDL	00:44:51,700	00:44:55,029	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	success counterinsurgency not primarily
EDL	00:44:55,029	00:44:57,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	by us but increasing
EDL	00:44:57,000	00:44:59,370	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	by the young guns I have some
EDL	00:44:59,370	00:45:01,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	reservations about the military aspects
EDL	00:45:01,650	00:45:04,680	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of the plans involved here I think
EDL	00:45:04,680	00:45:07,080	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	trying to create a national Afghan army
EDL	00:45:07,080	00:45:10,020	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	is a dubious proposition the emphasis
EDL	00:45:10,020	00:45:11,760	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	should be on the creation of local
EDL	00:45:11,760	00:45:14,250	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	militias time to local communities
EDL	00:45:14,250	00:45:17,280	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	villages and towns and based on ethnic
EDL	00:45:17,280	00:45:20,250	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	loyalties because we cannot ignore the
EDL	00:45:20,250	00:45:21,870	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	fact that there aren't very many
EDL	00:45:21,870	00:45:24,810	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	handguns in Afghanistan but there are a
EDL	00:45:24,810	00:45:28,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	lot of Afghan Pashtuns Afghan Tajiks

EDL	00:45:30,830	00:45:36,680	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Afghan turkmens Hazaras and others and
EDL	00:45:36,680	00:45:39,360	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	local communities are much more likely
EDL	00:45:39,360	00:45:41,730	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to be the basis for effective Afghan
EDL	00:45:41,730	00:45:45,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	response to the Taliban then the foreign
EDL	00:45:45,000	00:45:48,960	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	American European Army if we do some of
EDL	00:45:48,960	00:45:51,660	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	these things and particularly we do all
EDL	00:45:51,660	00:45:54,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of them intelligently we can begin to
EDL	00:45:54,330	00:45:57,420	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	diminish the salience of the long term
EDL	00:45:57,420	00:45:59,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	challenge or the part of the world that
EDL	00:45:59,910	00:46:02,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	is relatively new to political activism
EDL	00:46:02,460	00:46:07,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and which is increasingly captured by an
EDL	00:46:07,530	00:46:09,450	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	anti-american sentiment that is
EDL	00:46:09,450	00:46:12,470	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	extremely intense and violent based on
EDL	00:46:12,470	00:46:15,930	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	political and religious resentments and
EDL	00:46:15,930	00:46:18,270	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	if we can do that then I think we can
EDL	00:46:18,270	00:46:21,810	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	begin to be free of the burdens as
EDL	00:46:21,810	00:46:25,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	country imposes on us if we are not
EDL	00:46:25,220	00:46:27,960	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	we're going to be bombed down to an
EDL	00:46:27,960	00:46:30,540	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	increasingly debilitating extent because
EDL	00:46:30,540	00:46:33,930	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the costs involved physical economic
EDL	00:46:33,930	00:46:36,960	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which are enormous and political around
EDL	00:46:36,960	00:46:39,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the world and hence the stakes are quite
EDL	00:46:39,210	00:46:42,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	fundamental to our well-being the worn
EDL	00:46:42,210	00:46:45,180	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	against and now is the longest war in
EDL	00:46:45,180	00:46:48,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	American history it is now the longest
EDL	00:46:48,150	00:46:50,230	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	war fought in our
EDL	00:46:50,230	00:46:53,079	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	national history and it can only be a
EDL	00:46:53,079	00:46:56,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	war that's going to be won by Afghans
EDL	00:46:56,530	00:46:58,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	whom we help and we have to be
EDL	00:46:58,900	00:47:00,490	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	sophisticated and clever and dealing
EDL	00:47:00,490	00:47:02,589	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	with that and we have to be much more
EDL	00:47:02,589	00:47:05,800	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	effective in establishing some sort of
EDL	00:47:05,800	00:47:08,410	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	shared strategic understanding with
EDL	00:47:08,410	00:47:11,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Pakistan from guarding what happens
EDL	00:47:11,910	00:47:15,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	after the defeat of the Taliban because
EDL	00:47:15,190	00:47:18,339	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Pakistanis have a vital interest in
EDL	00:47:18,339	00:47:21,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Afghanistan being essentially a source
EDL	00:47:21,190	00:47:24,490	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of strategic security for them and not a
EDL	00:47:24,490	00:47:27,310	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	source of potential encirclement given
EDL	00:47:27,310	00:47:29,230	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	their obsessive and perhaps excessive
EDL	00:47:29,230	00:47:32,020	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	preoccupation with what they view as
EDL	00:47:32,020	00:47:36,810	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Indian challenge if we don't do well in
EDL	00:47:36,810	00:47:39,550	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Afghanistan Pakistan our problems in the
EDL	00:47:39,550	00:47:43,599	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Far East will intensify but our position
EDL	00:47:43,599	00:47:45,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in the fire is in any case is
EDL	00:47:45,940	00:47:49,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	increasingly under challenge largely
EDL	00:47:49,150	00:47:51,550	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	because of the shifts in the global
EDL	00:47:51,550	00:47:55,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	parameters and while we are striving to
EDL	00:47:55,210	00:47:57,700	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	achieve right now a cooperative
EDL	00:47:57,700	00:48:00,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	partnership with China in which we
EDL	00:48:00,400	00:48:03,040	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	recognize that each is dependent on the
EDL	00:48:03,040	00:48:05,380	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	other and that is a new realization
EDL	00:48:05,380	00:48:07,990	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that's beginning to sink in both here
EDL	00:48:07,990	00:48:10,630	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and in China there are still enormous
EDL	00:48:10,630	00:48:13,660	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	regional pressures as well as historical
EDL	00:48:13,660	00:48:16,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	forces at work that can push the support
EDL	00:48:16,710	00:48:19,599	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Chinese throughout the last two
EDL	00:48:19,599	00:48:22,450	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	decades while rising dramatically have
EDL	00:48:22,450	00:48:25,420	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	been very careful to minimize their
EDL	00:48:25,420	00:48:27,849	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	prospects they repeatedly say we're
EDL	00:48:27,849	00:48:30,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	rising peacefully but it is not our
EDL	00:48:30,190	00:48:32,980	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	ambition to be a global superpower or
EDL	00:48:32,980	00:48:36,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	equal to the United States and we're far
EDL	00:48:36,010	00:48:38,940	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	too backwards to under develop for that
EDL	00:48:38,940	00:48:42,160	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	but that mood is changing if you read

EDL	00:49:12,280	00:49:15,100	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	particularly in the Far East and it's
EDL	00:49:15,100	00:49:17,350	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	not an accident but it's a source of
EDL	00:49:17,350	00:49:19,690	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	concern and an interesting one the
EDL	00:49:19,690	00:49:22,510	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Chinese are now talking openly about an
EDL	00:49:22,510	00:49:25,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	East Asian community an East Asian
EDL	00:49:25,330	00:49:28,690	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	community in which they and the

EDL	00:49:30,490	00:49:32,800	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	country will be essentially an
EDL	00:49:32,800	00:49:36,340	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	increasingly integrated reality matching
EDL	00:49:36,340	00:49:39,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the EU without the political dimension
EDL	00:49:39,150	00:49:41,950	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	explicitly being mentioned but with the

EDL	00:49:43,930	00:49:46,330	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Chinese and the other putative members
EDL	00:49:46,330	00:49:48,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of that community the political
EDL	00:49:48,190	00:49:51,340	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	dimension is predetermined it will be if
EDL	00:49:51,340	00:49:53,380	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	it comes to pass and is beginning to
EDL	00:49:53,380	00:49:56,290	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	come to pass a Chinese sphere of
EDL	00:49:56,290	00:50:00,610	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	influence left unstated is the role of
EDL	00:50:00,610	00:50:03,250	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the United States but it is quite clear
EDL	00:50:03,250	00:50:05,260	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that is going to be a very much
EDL	00:50:05,260	00:50:08,590	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	diminished role and what is increasing
EDL	00:50:08,590	00:50:11,260	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	there should be of concern it is that

EDL	00:50:22,960	00:50:26,440	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and of South Korea they also are talking
EDL	00:50:26,440	00:50:29,740	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	about an East Asian community involving
EDL	00:50:29,740	00:50:33,250	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	themselves and the Chinese and the
EDL	00:50:33,250	00:50:36,730	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	others all the way to ASEAN and clearly
EDL	00:50:36,730	00:50:39,280	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in that context there is the beginning
EDL	00:50:39,280	00:50:42,190	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of three-way cooperation between China
EDL	00:50:42,190	00:50:45,280	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and the new government of Japan which is
EDL	00:50:45,280	00:50:48,490	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	beginning to think about revising the
EDL	00:50:48,490	00:50:50,410	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	fundamental geopolitical assumptions
EDL	00:50:50,410	00:50:54,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that have guided Japan since 1945 to
EDL	00:50:54,220	00:50:56,620	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	think about an East Asian community as
EDL	00:50:56,620	00:50:58,830	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	something to be shared with the Chinese
EDL	00:50:58,830	00:51:01,930	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	but the South Koreans with increasingly
EDL	00:51:01,930	00:51:05,320	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	large international ambitions develop
EDL	00:51:05,320	00:51:07,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	vied their economic success are
EDL	00:51:07,210	00:51:09,610	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	beginning again to talk about an East
EDL	00:51:09,610	00:51:12,780	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Asian community the emphasis is on
EDL	00:51:12,780	00:51:14,980	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	constructive cooperation our
EDL	00:51:14,980	00:51:17,920	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Commendation harmonious world as the
EDL	00:51:17,920	00:51:20,830	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Chinese say but increasingly also
EDL	00:51:20,830	00:51:22,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	particularly in Chinese strategic
EDL	00:51:22,900	00:51:26,590	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	thinking there are overtones of we have
EDL	00:51:26,590	00:51:29,290	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to respond to pressures from the United
EDL	00:51:29,290	00:51:32,080	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	States we have to respond to the efforts
EDL	00:51:32,080	00:51:34,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to contain China's influence and
EDL	00:51:34,000	00:51:36,510	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	therefore we have to have this outrage
EDL	00:51:36,510	00:51:40,090	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	based on communality of interest in a
EDL	00:51:40,090	00:51:43,060	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	world in a part of the world in which
EDL	00:51:43,060	00:51:45,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Chinese preeminence is deeply
EDL	00:51:45,460	00:51:48,130	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	entrenched and a strong cultural and
EDL	00:51:48,130	00:51:51,040	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	historical appeal in addition to current
EDL	00:51:51,040	00:51:55,720	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	geopolitical realities all of that means
EDL	00:51:55,720	00:51:58,390	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	that gradually the United States may be
EDL	00:51:58,390	00:52:00,100	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in the process of they coming
EDL	00:52:00,100	00:52:02,920	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	marginalized in a part of the world in
EDL	00:52:02,920	00:52:04,750	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which we found ourselves to be as
EDL	00:52:04,750	00:52:07,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	entrenched and as dominant as we have
EDL	00:52:07,900	00:52:11,320	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	felt to be the case in Europe since 1945
EDL	00:52:11,320	00:52:13,720	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and that too has far-reaching
EDL	00:52:13,720	00:52:16,560	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	implications for our role in the world
EDL	00:52:16,560	00:52:19,210	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and that brings me to the last and final
EDL	00:52:19,210	00:52:22,780	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	point in that setting there's a real
EDL	00:52:22,780	00:52:25,060	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	risk that we and the Europeans
EDL	00:52:25,060	00:52:27,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	instead of working more closely together
EDL	00:52:27,900	00:52:31,720	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to refashion an energetic Atlantic world
EDL	00:52:31,720	00:52:34,690	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	no longer globally dominant but capable
EDL	00:52:34,690	00:52:37,030	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in a constructive way to influence the
EDL	00:52:37,030	00:52:39,610	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	world in part because also of our values
EDL	00:52:39,610	00:52:42,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and a highly successful way of life will
EDL	00:52:42,910	00:52:46,800	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	become less and less likely as a reality
EDL	00:52:46,800	00:52:50,740	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Europeans are skeptical about our
EDL	00:52:50,740	00:52:53,020	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	role in the Middle East the Europeans
EDL	00:52:53,020	00:52:55,570	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	feel we have been delinquent not moving
EDL	00:52:55,570	00:52:59,770	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	more fairly and energetically in favor
EDL	00:52:59,770	00:53:02,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of a peace process they questioned some
EDL	00:53:02,530	00:53:05,800	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	of our assumptions regarding Iraq Iran
EDL	00:53:05,800	00:53:07,630	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and Afghanistan
EDL	00:53:07,630	00:53:11,109	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Eastern and they feel uneasy about our
EDL	00:53:11,109	00:53:13,509	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	relationship with the Russians which
EDL	00:53:13,509	00:53:15,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	they feel in some respects we're not
EDL	00:53:15,640	00:53:17,979	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	sufficiently responsive to Russian
EDL	00:53:17,979	00:53:21,759	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	concerns in some cases the Europeans are
EDL	00:53:21,759	00:53:24,249	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	perhaps excessively indifferent to the
EDL	00:53:24,249	00:53:26,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	danger that they will become dependent
EDL	00:53:26,400	00:53:30,009	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	energy-wise and tired and Russia we
EDL	00:53:30,009	00:53:32,140	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	would like the Europeans to be more
EDL	00:53:32,140	00:53:35,410	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	receptive to Turkey and welcome Turkey
EDL	00:53:35,410	00:53:38,049	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	into the European Union because we see
EDL	00:53:38,049	00:53:40,630	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in that the possibility of a more
EDL	00:53:40,630	00:53:43,450	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	constructive European influence on the
EDL	00:53:43,450	00:53:45,999	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Middle East in the Muslim world the
EDL	00:53:45,999	00:53:48,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Europeans wanted to keep the Turks out
EDL	00:53:48,460	00:53:51,729	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	almost explicitly now having promised
EDL	00:53:51,729	00:53:54,759	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Turks in the mid-1960s that they'll
EDL	00:53:54,759	00:53:56,950	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	be welcomed to the European Union and
EDL	00:53:56,950	00:53:59,160	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Turks themselves are now moving
EDL	00:53:59,160	00:54:01,299	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	towards a regional policy of
EDL	00:54:01,299	00:54:05,559	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	independence based on a reassertion but
EDL	00:54:05,559	00:54:07,869	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the relevance to contemporary Turkey of
EDL	00:54:07,869	00:54:10,989	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the Ottoman experience and the Ottoman
EDL	00:54:10,989	00:54:14,349	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	outreach these are complicated issues in
EDL	00:54:14,349	00:54:16,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which in American European dialogue is
EDL	00:54:16,900	00:54:20,140	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	desperately needed but it's difficult to
EDL	00:54:20,140	00:54:21,729	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	conduct it with rather different
EDL	00:54:21,729	00:54:24,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	historical visions and in the absence of
EDL	00:54:24,640	00:54:27,460	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	European leadership that makes the
EDL	00:54:27,460	00:54:31,269	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	possibility of a drift apart more likely
EDL	00:54:31,269	00:54:33,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	thereby further complicating our
EDL	00:54:33,910	00:54:37,479	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	position in the world all of that means
EDL	00:54:37,479	00:54:40,630	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and I concluded this thought is that we
EDL	00:54:40,630	00:54:43,719	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	in the foreseeable future have to face
EDL	00:54:43,719	00:54:45,060	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the fact that our foreign
EDL	00:54:45,060	00:54:47,550	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	policy will have to be capable of
EDL	00:54:47,550	00:54:50,660	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	addressing intelligently the enormous
EDL	00:54:50,660	00:54:54,150	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	complexities of contemporary world it is
EDL	00:54:54,150	00:54:56,340	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	not a world susceptible anymore
EDL	00:54:56,340	00:54:58,850	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	to many key and views of right and wrong

EDL	00:55:20,550	00:55:23,670	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	is the greatest impediment to an
EDL	00:55:23,670	00:55:26,430	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	intelligent policy because it drives the

EDL	00:55:32,190	00:55:34,110	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	having an increasingly polarized
EDL	00:55:34,110	00:55:37,470	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	dialogue about foreign policy we have
EDL	00:55:37,470	00:55:39,630	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	increasing difficulties in fashioning a
EDL	00:55:39,630	00:55:43,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	bipartisan foreign policy in fact we no
EDL	00:55:43,650	00:55:47,000	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	longer have that bipartisan form of
EDL	00:55:47,000	00:55:49,680	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	bipartisanship and foreign policy has
EDL	00:55:49,680	00:55:52,590	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	now been dead for about 10 years at

EDL	00:55:56,100	00:55:58,320	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	started immediately in the wake of 9/11
EDL	00:55:58,320	00:56:04,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and in the rather extreme and
EDL	00:56:04,910	00:56:08,100	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	black-and-white formulations that the
EDL	00:56:08,100	00:56:10,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	preceding administration adopted in
EDL	00:56:10,530	00:56:14,310	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	response to 9/11 not to mention the
EDL	00:56:14,310	00:56:17,220	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	decision to wager unilateral war for
EDL	00:56:17,220	00:56:19,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which there was no international support
EDL	00:56:19,400	00:56:22,200	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	and regarding which the American public
EDL	00:56:22,200	00:56:25,830	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	was divided and regarding which it was
EDL	00:56:25,830	00:56:29,250	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	badly misled on the fundamental reasons
EDL	00:56:29,250	00:56:32,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	for the war so today bipartisanship
EDL	00:56:32,640	00:56:35,040	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	doesn't exist at a time when it is
EDL	00:56:35,040	00:56:37,040	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	needed more than ever before
EDL	00:56:37,040	00:56:40,040	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	because on the bipartisanship and
EDL	00:56:40,040	00:56:42,770	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	for this country a foreign pause in the
EDL	00:56:42,770	00:56:46,580	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	country can indoors and the United

EDL	00:56:49,460	00:56:51,310	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	what makes this extremely difficult
EDL	00:56:51,310	00:56:53,900	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	today to deal with foreign policy
EDL	00:56:53,900	00:56:57,020	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	intelligently and beyond that of course
EDL	00:56:57,020	00:56:59,950	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	there is the enormous domestic agenda
EDL	00:56:59,950	00:57:03,770	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which has piled up in part because of
EDL	00:57:03,770	00:57:06,140	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the enormous costs of our global
EDL	00:57:06,140	00:57:09,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	involvement which we couldn't avoid but
EDL	00:57:09,530	00:57:11,720	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	which has contributed to mortgaging some
EDL	00:57:11,720	00:57:13,640	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	aspects of our future to our
EDL	00:57:13,640	00:57:18,080	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	indebtedness humility that calls for a
EDL	00:57:18,080	00:57:20,270	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	response in which the public becomes
EDL	00:57:20,270	00:57:23,710	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	increasingly aware of what is going on
EDL	00:57:23,710	00:57:26,480	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the role of the president in educating
EDL	00:57:26,480	00:57:28,120	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the public should not be underestimated
EDL	00:57:28,120	00:57:30,650	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	it's probably more important today than
EDL	00:57:30,650	00:57:33,500	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	ever before because it was easier to
EDL	00:57:33,500	00:57:36,530	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	mobilize national resistance after Pearl
EDL	00:57:36,530	00:57:39,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	Harbor it was easier to mobilize
EDL	00:57:39,010	00:57:41,540	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	national commitment because of the
EDL	00:57:41,540	00:57:45,590	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	dangers of a nuclear war today informing
EDL	00:57:45,590	00:57:47,480	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the public what is needed what is the
EDL	00:57:47,480	00:57:49,610	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	balance between an intelligent domestic
EDL	00:57:49,610	00:57:52,910	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	policy and foreign policy is enormously
EDL	00:57:52,910	00:57:56,030	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	complicated on many dimensions and hence

EDL	00:57:56,030	00:57:59,390	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	we all have an obligation to try to
EDL	00:57:59,390	00:58:01,400	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	generate in this country a serious
EDL	00:58:01,400	00:58:04,010	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	discussion of the issues and of course
EDL	00:58:04,010	00:58:05,840	| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWZB_kEwUo |	the role of institutions such as yours
