EDL	00:03:18,131	00:03:22,435	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	So Alibaba has been deploying FIDO
EDL	00:03:22,435	00:03:24,904	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	internally in enterprise, and
EDL	00:03:24,904	00:03:26,005	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:03:26,005	00:03:29,209	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	Wang Kong is here to talk about learnings
EDL	00:03:29,209	00:03:30,410	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	and wishes. So maybe
EDL	00:03:30,410	00:03:33,046	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	some of the lessons learned,
EDL	00:03:33,046	00:03:34,614	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	but maybe some of the challenges that
EDL	00:03:34,614	00:03:37,217	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	we're looking to overcome with FIDO in
EDL	00:03:37,217	00:03:38,051	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	the enterprise space.
EDL	00:03:38,051	00:03:40,186	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	So please help me welcome Wang Kang.

EDL	00:03:45,658	00:03:49,629	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	Okay, thank you, Megan. I'll read my

EDL	00:03:53,433	00:03:56,636	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	I have no memory about words. So good

EDL	00:03:58,605	00:04:02,175	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	I have worked in Alibaba Group for more

EDL	00:04:33,006	00:04:35,241	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	I'm the one who gets a visa in time. I
EDL	00:04:35,241	00:04:37,377	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	got my first Yubikey on
EDL	00:04:37,377	00:04:40,480	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	Taobao.com back a few years ago,
EDL	00:04:40,480	00:04:40,813	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:04:40,813	00:04:42,315	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	and the second free sample
EDL	00:04:42,315	00:04:45,051	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	from Yubikey on Black Hat 2015.
EDL	00:04:45,051	00:04:45,952	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:04:45,952	00:04:47,520	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	And the next year I got free
EDL	00:04:47,520	00:04:50,590	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	stickers. So thank you, Yubikey.
EDL	00:04:50,590	00:04:51,357	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:04:51,357	00:04:55,828	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	And a big thank you to Google for their
EDL	00:04:55,828	00:04:57,697	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	pioneer work on U2F.
EDL	00:04:57,697	00:05:01,734	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 4.0 secs ]
EDL	00:05:01,734	00:05:04,404	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	So since 2018, we have been planning to
EDL	00:05:04,404	00:05:05,872	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	adopt FIDO, finally it's
EDL	00:05:05,872	00:05:08,374	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	deployed in last spring.
EDL	00:05:08,374	00:05:08,908	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:05:08,908	00:05:11,010	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	Now FIDO has been an authentication
EDL	00:05:11,010	00:05:13,179	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	method not only as a second factor,
EDL	00:05:13,179	00:05:16,416	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	but also as a first factor on the login
EDL	00:05:16,416	00:05:19,018	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	web page of the intranet for employees.
EDL	00:05:19,018	00:05:22,955	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	It is user friendly, fish resistant, and
EDL	00:05:22,955	00:05:24,524	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	loved by our colleagues,
EDL	00:05:24,524	00:05:25,024	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:05:25,024	00:05:26,526	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	although there is still a
EDL	00:05:26,526	00:05:28,428	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	very few privacy concerns.
EDL	00:05:28,428	00:05:29,228	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:05:29,228	00:05:31,831	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	For example, Touch ID, not all our
EDL	00:05:31,831	00:05:33,466	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	employees feel comfortable when the
EDL	00:05:33,466	00:05:36,436	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	finger is touched on a black square.
EDL	00:05:36,436	00:05:38,004	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:05:38,004	00:05:39,005	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	But overall, they are
EDL	00:05:39,005	00:05:41,107	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	persuaded and happy to use it.
EDL	00:05:41,107	00:05:41,474	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:05:41,474	00:05:43,309	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	I'll quickly share a few cases to help
EDL	00:05:43,309	00:05:46,012	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	other organizations to adopt FIDO
EDL	00:05:46,012	00:05:47,246	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	and share a few things
EDL	00:05:47,246	00:05:48,614	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	that we are still wishing for.
EDL	00:05:48,614	00:05:50,483	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]
EDL	00:05:50,483	00:05:52,652	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	So the benefits, strategies,
EDL	00:05:52,652	00:05:53,319	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:05:53,319	00:05:55,421	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	real user cases, and wishes.
EDL	00:05:55,421	00:05:56,889	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:05:56,889	00:05:59,559	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	What tie our hands? The first efforts
EDL	00:05:59,559	00:06:01,394	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	can date back to 2018.
EDL	00:06:01,394	00:06:01,994	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:06:01,994	00:06:03,596	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	When I was investigating the
EDL	00:06:03,596	00:06:05,698	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	key wrapping mechanism of U2F,
EDL	00:06:05,698	00:06:06,132	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:06:06,132	00:06:10,036	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	I found an attack called U2F fishing,
EDL	00:06:10,036	00:06:10,670	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:06:10,670	00:06:11,971	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	published on Virus Bulletin.
EDL	00:06:11,971	00:06:12,405	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:06:12,405	00:06:15,641	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	But during that process, I found U2F is
EDL	00:06:15,641	00:06:17,210	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	actually a very good design.
EDL	00:06:17,210	00:06:17,877	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:06:17,877	00:06:20,480	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	It's so good that you can use a single
EDL	00:06:20,480	00:06:22,949	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	chip to generate an
EDL	00:06:22,949	00:06:26,285	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	infinitive amount of private key pairs.
EDL	00:06:26,285	00:06:27,420	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:06:27,420	00:06:30,790	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	But to deploy in a large scale, inside an
EDL	00:06:30,790	00:06:32,492	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	organization, there are three things that
EDL	00:06:32,492	00:06:34,026	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	still tie our hands.
EDL	00:06:34,026	00:06:39,599	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	Cost, because the extra hardware, so many
EDL	00:06:39,599	00:06:42,268	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	employees, the exact number of it can be
EDL	00:06:42,268	00:06:43,970	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	found on the SEC filings.
EDL	00:06:43,970	00:06:44,670	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:06:44,670	00:06:48,107	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	It's around 240 Ks. We cannot afford it
EDL	00:06:48,107	00:06:51,144	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	at least in the early times when no one,
EDL	00:06:51,144	00:06:52,078	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:06:52,078	00:06:53,746	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	including the boss, sees the benefits.
EDL	00:06:53,746	00:06:54,547	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:06:54,547	00:06:56,516	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	And there are all devices, hundreds of
EDL	00:06:56,516	00:06:59,318	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	existing web applications, and plus
EDL	00:06:59,318	00:07:01,721	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	iCloud are not allowed.
EDL	00:07:01,721	00:07:02,021	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:07:02,021	00:07:04,991	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	I believe other enterprises also ban it as well.
EDL	00:07:04,991	00:07:06,192	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:07:06,192	00:07:10,863	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	The thing is how do we measure the benefits? After all 
EDL	00:07:10,863	00:07:11,364	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:07:11,364	00:07:14,534	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	It is a defensive mechanism. It doesn't
EDL	00:07:14,534	00:07:16,369	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	show benefits immediately.
EDL	00:07:16,369	00:07:17,570	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:07:17,570	00:07:20,606	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	I'll address them in the following slides.
EDL	00:07:20,606	00:07:21,007	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:07:21,007	00:07:29,182	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	We now have 40,000 employees

EDL	00:07:32,285	00:07:32,985	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:07:32,985	00:07:34,454	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	We are not doing massive forcing
EDL	00:07:34,454	00:07:36,622	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	policies, so the real user feedbacks can
EDL	00:07:36,622	00:07:40,092	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	be measured by a natural, organic way.
EDL	00:07:40,092	00:07:41,227	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:07:41,227	00:07:44,130	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	The ratio of the active users in the last
EDL	00:07:44,130	00:07:46,532	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	30 days divided by the number of
EDL	00:07:46,532	00:07:48,668	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	registered users is around 53%.
EDL	00:07:48,668	00:07:50,002	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:07:50,002	00:07:53,573	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	I believe that proves that users really love FIDO.
EDL	00:07:53,573	00:07:54,307	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:07:54,307	00:07:57,109	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	Some users will come back to us even when
EDL	00:07:57,109	00:07:59,445	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	something goes wrong and Touch ID won't work.
EDL	00:07:59,445	00:08:00,112	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:08:00,112	00:08:04,283	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	This "come back to us" thing is very rare
EDL	00:08:04,283	00:08:05,952	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	in our company because our
EDL	00:08:05,952	00:08:07,253	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	colleagues are very focused.
EDL	00:08:07,253	00:08:08,054	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:08:08,054	00:08:09,222	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	They didn't care anything
EDL	00:08:09,222	00:08:10,356	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	other than their own work.
EDL	00:08:10,356	00:08:11,991	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:08:11,991	00:08:16,495	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	This also shows FIDO is a good design.
EDL	00:08:16,495	00:08:22,068	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 5.6 secs ]
EDL	00:08:22,068	00:08:24,871	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	The benefits, FIDO is very fast. I myself

EDL	00:08:29,809	00:08:33,813	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	I once won a bicycle by

EDL	00:08:37,717	00:08:38,017	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:08:38,017	00:08:41,654	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	I have to say, when it comes to 10 times
EDL	00:08:41,654	00:08:43,122	| Authenticate2023-alibaba |	a day, typing a password

EDL	00:02:58,257	00:03:01,717	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	it is increased by 10%
EDL	00:03:01,717	00:03:07,026	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	It's a natural way we do not promote or we do not persuade the user to register the FIDO keys

EDL	00:03:13,317	00:03:15,007	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So by rough calculation

EDL	00:03:15,326	00:03:22,106	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	we saved over 1 million second factor text messages over the last year
EDL	00:03:22,106	00:03:25,456	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So I think it's a good indicator that our employees
EDL	00:03:25,456	00:03:27,026	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	really love Passkey
EDL	00:03:27,026	00:03:29,377	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So compared to last year
EDL	00:03:29,377	00:03:33,637	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	user reported issues are are decreasing significantly
EDL	00:03:33,637	00:03:39,836	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So the main issue is from the iFrame websites
EDL	00:03:39,836	00:03:40,706	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	iFrame websites
EDL	00:03:40,706	00:03:43,257	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	because there are so many internal websites
EDL	00:03:43,257	00:03:44,157	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	web applications
EDL	00:03:44,157	00:03:52,766	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	people sometimes will build a portal websites to embed a bunch of websites together by HTML iFrame tags

EDL	00:04:01,167	00:04:01,706	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So of course
EDL	00:04:01,706	00:04:03,567	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	they should design something better

EDL	00:04:25,257	00:04:33,439	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	we have to decide to ban Safari from accessing passkey in our in enterprise currently
EDL	00:04:33,439	00:04:35,033	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	compared to last year
EDL	00:04:35,033	00:04:42,997	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	we user report issues decrease significantly and the rest portion of issues are bearable

EDL	00:04:53,697	00:04:55,877	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	according to the public documents
EDL	00:04:55,877	00:04:59,776	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	we have more than 240,000 employees
EDL	00:04:59,776	00:05:02,487	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	And based on our current progress
EDL	00:05:02,487	00:05:04,437	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	only 10% of them are covered
EDL	00:05:04,437	00:05:10,666	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So we are we will roll out more quickly in the next few six months
EDL	00:05:10,666	00:05:12,677	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	Here's technical challenge solutions
EDL	00:05:12,677	00:05:14,247	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So use case 1

EDL	00:05:14,627	00:05:16,307	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	iFrame and cookies
EDL	00:05:16,307	00:05:17,637	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	As I mentioned
EDL	00:05:17,637	00:05:22,697	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	it's easier for the developer to build a system using iFrame piles of them
EDL	00:05:22,697	00:05:28,416	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	We have to add allow publickey-credentials-get attribute in the outside web page
EDL	00:05:28,416	00:05:32,476	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	Otherwise it won't be presenting web key UI
EDL	00:05:32,476	00:05:36,377	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	But this approach requires lots of developmental
EDL	00:05:36,377	00:05:37,387	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	lots of changes
EDL	00:05:37,387	00:05:38,346	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:05:38,346	00:05:39,677	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	It's quite annoying
EDL	00:05:39,677	00:05:43,887	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So since we have control of the single sign on site
EDL	00:05:43,887	00:05:45,976	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	so the solution #2 is is easier
EDL	00:05:45,976	00:05:49,047	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	We just have to detect if inside a iFrame
EDL	00:05:49,047	00:05:51,822	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	sometimes we will jump out of the frame
EDL	00:05:51,822	00:05:55,776	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	or prompt the user saying you are currently inside a frame
EDL	00:05:55,776	00:05:58,309	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	please just click this the popup link
EDL	00:05:58,309	00:06:01,547	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	so that you can get a login page in a new tab
EDL	00:06:01,547	00:06:05,627	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So then the user can return to iFrame page if they still want

EDL	00:06:07,047	00:06:16,846	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	and to the third party cookie, part of the iFrame issue comes from the third party cookie
EDL	00:06:16,846	00:06:21,117	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	We have a centralized domain top domain for SSO
EDL	00:06:21,117	00:06:27,459	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	but sometimes business unit will use different domains that will cause such kind of problems
EDL	00:06:27,459	00:06:32,507	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	We have prepared to guide the user to approve third party cookies initially

EDL	00:06:34,297	00:06:35,107	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	then later
EDL	00:06:35,107	00:06:39,278	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	We have to launch a huge project crossing the whole group
EDL	00:06:39,278	00:06:44,221	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	to migrate, to upgrade those apps with third party cookies
EDL	00:06:44,221	00:06:49,346	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	because Google announced that it will abandon the third party support in the future
EDL	00:06:49,346	00:06:50,697	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So and we have
EDL	00:06:50,697	00:06:51,137	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	you know
EDL	00:06:51,137	00:06:57,007	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	we have more than 10K enterprise web apps to upgrade a huge work

EDL	00:06:57,536	00:07:03,377	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	And then Google decided to postpone the campaign under some pressure from the community, I think
EDL	00:07:03,377	00:07:04,377	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	But unfortunately
EDL	00:07:04,377	00:07:05,836	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	we already have the top 10

EDL	00:07:09,947	00:07:14,247	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	They have decoupled from the third party cookies.
EDL	00:07:14,247	00:07:16,052	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	thank you Google so,
EDL	00:07:16,052	00:07:18,156	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	our problem has been solved.
EDL	00:07:18,156	00:07:22,677	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So the use case #2 the native apps and the containers
EDL	00:07:22,677	00:07:25,007	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	there's another case
EDL	00:07:25,007	00:07:26,766	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	I think it's worth sharing

EDL	00:12:12,187	00:12:16,986	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	probably maybe because of an unperfect upgrade from a lower version of Windows

EDL	00:12:24,397	00:12:26,287	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	Yeah most of the time it will work

EDL	00:12:26,856	00:12:27,606	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	Just remember

EDL	00:12:29,636	00:12:33,317	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	You have to turn off PIN, Face and fingerprint at all once

EDL	00:12:33,966	00:12:35,280	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	otherwise it won't reset
EDL	00:12:35,280	00:12:39,557	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	and sometimes reset the browser cache will help
EDL	00:12:39,557	00:12:40,136	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	Okay
EDL	00:12:40,136	00:12:40,966	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	key password manager
EDL	00:12:40,966	00:12:41,947	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:12:41,947	00:12:47,366	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	We learned some design from very famous password manager apps
EDL	00:12:47,366	00:12:47,797	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:12:47,797	00:12:55,147	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	Also even Apple released a password manager a few weeks ago in their new iOS operating system
EDL	00:12:55,147	00:12:56,667	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:12:56,667	00:13:01,917	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	like 1Password or bitwarden and they used a technique called monkey patch
EDL	00:13:01,917	00:13:07,481	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So monkey patch has been widely used in JavaScript for backward compatibility
EDL	00:13:07,481	00:13:11,447	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	or for hacking because some new language does not support it
EDL	00:13:11,447	00:13:12,736	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	some new APIs
EDL	00:13:12,736	00:13:13,917	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	or in older browsers
EDL	00:13:13,917	00:13:14,417	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:13:14,417	00:13:17,817	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	people have to define in that way
EDL	00:13:17,817	00:13:19,927	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So password manager is a browser extension
EDL	00:13:19,927	00:13:22,264	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	We can set up a wide browser extension
EDL	00:13:22,264	00:13:28,167	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	and inject our scripting code into into the browser to hijack web application APIs
EDL	00:13:28,167	00:13:28,856	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	for example
EDL	00:13:28,856	00:13:31,197	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	navigate.credentials.create
EDL	00:13:31,197	00:13:34,710	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So when the WebAuthn is called password manager will be brought up
EDL	00:13:34,710	00:13:39,456	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	and first before we get the chance to use the default UI
EDL	00:13:39,456	00:13:48,517	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	this is a simple example JavaScript demo for how the monkey patch works
EDL	00:13:48,517	00:13:49,537	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So to achieve this
EDL	00:13:49,537	00:13:54,746	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	we injected with user script extension like GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey
EDL	00:13:54,746	00:13:55,626	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	Of course it's a  demo
EDL	00:13:55,626	00:13:59,147	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	Also to test this
EDL	00:13:59,147	00:14:02,326	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	you need to enable the development mode of your browser
EDL	00:14:02,326	00:14:08,307	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	We can also use this code snippet to start building your own Passkey forwarder

EDL	00:14:08,876	00:14:14,956	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	However browser seems to consider behavior is a high risk so have to turn on the developer mode, yes
EDL	00:14:14,956	00:14:17,506	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	[ SPACE 2.5 secs ]
EDL	00:14:17,506	00:14:22,224	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So from the discussion from the foreseeing developers one year ago
EDL	00:14:22,224	00:14:26,606	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	and some concern from someone more years
EDL	00:14:26,606	00:14:27,697	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	seven years ago
EDL	00:14:27,697	00:14:28,567	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	it's not perfect
EDL	00:14:28,567	00:14:32,767	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	but for test purposes is enough
EDL	00:14:32,767	00:14:33,277	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:14:33,277	00:14:34,057	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	Okay

EDL	00:14:34,636	00:14:39,230	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	so here's the now next to the future thought
EDL	00:14:39,230	00:14:48,549	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	I'd like to share first is the a few new designs from our colleague Mr Wang Kang
EDL	00:14:48,549	00:14:41,509	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	Low budget gadgets
EDL	00:14:41,509	00:14:42,019	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:14:42,019	00:14:46,090	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	We are currently using platform authenticators
EDL	00:14:46,090	00:14:48,080	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	in some cases
EDL	00:14:48,080	00:14:49,070	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:14:49,070	00:14:50,408	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	it may not work.
EDL	00:14:50,408	00:14:58,450	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	We look at USB security keys and they support all kinds of computers, phones, browsers and operating system
EDL	00:14:58,450	00:14:59,039	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:14:59,039	00:15:01,480	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	but they are currently very expensive
EDL	00:15:01,480	00:15:08,429	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	especially when we think about the deployer hundreds of thousands of keys to the company
EDL	00:15:08,429	00:15:14,039	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	Yeah, so we also tried NFC card that has FIDO 2.0 support
EDL	00:15:14,039	00:15:15,669	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	It works pretty well
EDL	00:15:15,669	00:15:20,049	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	but Chrome on Android only supports FIDO 1.0

EDL	00:15:20,590	00:15:24,149	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So why we don't just make an NFC card reader
EDL	00:15:24,149	00:15:26,220	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	and maybe as a bridge
EDL	00:15:26,220	00:15:30,299	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	translate those protocol into the FIDO 2 USB HID device
EDL	00:15:30,299	00:15:31,000	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:15:31,000	00:15:35,549	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So we are now working with Infineon and the card manufacturer Watchdata

EDL	00:15:35,960	00:15:40,679	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So please feel free to talk with me or Infineon in the expo hall later
EDL	00:15:40,679	00:15:42,750	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	So there will be concerns
EDL	00:15:42,750	00:15:43,870	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	will it work?

EDL	00:15:44,600	00:15:52,909	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	And we looked carefully into the documents and found that chapter teaching us how to migrate U2F to FIDO2
EDL	00:15:52,909	00:15:55,320	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	And yesterday evening
EDL	00:15:55,320	00:15:56,789	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	I also visited the expo hall

EDL	00:16:05,590	00:16:07,440	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	I think it's possible
EDL	00:16:07,440	00:16:09,440	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	And according to the document
EDL	00:16:09,440	00:16:13,820	| Authenticate2024-alibaba |	I think the crypto signature also does not need to be regenerated
